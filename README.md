# iframe-demo
This repo demonstrate the implementation of embedding terrific iframe on localhost.

## local run
```bash
npm i && node index.js
```

## remarks
You'll need to set https on your local, as on terrific.live there is an auto redirect from http to https and it breaks the frame ancestors headers set for localhost.
